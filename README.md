### Tech stack of _Bloggify_,

### Features of _Bloggify_,

- Implemented all CRUD operations i.e. a user can Create an article, Update the
existing article, delete an article and See all the articles.

- As we can use Markdowns, so to provide security I have used DOMPurify which
sanitizes HTML and prevents XSS attacks
